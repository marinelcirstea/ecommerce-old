# Ecom with Razzle and React

## THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT MAINTAINED!!!
I barely remembered it, I just found it in the repo list and decided to make it public.
I remember it was functional, with categories, products, csv import and all the good stuff. I remember it being configured for both Firebase Hosting and Google App Engine(with Docker)

### Use at your own risk!
I have nothing against taking a look at the code to see how I used to do things, but nothing more.
If you want to build an ecomerce website with React, I recommend Next.js.

Have a good day/night!
